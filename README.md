# CLI_Project
My Pokemon CLI project.

This CLI project is a program that gets data from PokeAPI which is used 
to research attributes from a variety of Pokemon. This program allows 
you to choose specific Pokemon from a set list in order to view their 
characteristics.

Before running the program enter 'bundle install' in your terminal to install all necessary gems.

To run the program enter 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal.
If an error occurs, then enter 'ruby CLI_Project/bin/run.rb' in your terminal.
