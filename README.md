# CLI_Project
My Pokemon CLI project for Flatiron School.

This CLI project is a program that gets data from PokeAPI which is used 
to research characteristics of many different Pokemon. This program allows 
you to search specific traits of any Pokemon, such as, moves and abilities. 
You're also able to get descriptions of any move or ability by searching for 
them inside the program.

Before running the program enter 'bundle install' in your terminal to install all necessary gems.

To run the program enter 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal.
